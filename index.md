I am currently a research engineer at Alibaba Group.
Before that, I was advised by [Chao Du](https://duchao0726.github.io/) during my research internship at Alibaba.
I finished my master's study in Computer Science at *ShanghaiTech University* in 2022, supervised by [Xuming He](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/hexm/index.html).
At that time I was also elected as
one of the <ins>Outstanding Graduates of Shanghai</ins> (1% province-wide).
I received a Bachelor's degree from *Wuhan University* in 2019, where I earned the prestigious <ins>National Scholarship</ins> (0.2% nation-wide) in 2017.

I have a broad research experience in machine learning, including
Reinforcement Learning, Variational Bayes, Vison and Language. <ins>Currently, I am super excited about research on Generative AI, and I am looking for opportunities / research collaborations on relevant topics.</ins> For more details, please check out my [CV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HazekiahWon/helios2/master/assets/Research_CV.pdf).
