I am currently a research engineer at Alibaba Group.
Before that, I was advised by [Chao Du](https://duchao0726.github.io/) during my research internship at Alibaba.
I finished my master's study in Computer Science at ShanghaiTech University in 2022, supervised by [Xuming He](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/hexm/index.html).
At that time I was also nominated as
one of the Outstanding Graduates of Shanghai (1%).
I received a Bachelor's degree from Wuhan University in 2019, and earned the National Scholarship (1%) in 2017.

I have a broad research experience in machine learning, including
Reinforcement Learning, Variational Bayes, Robustness, Vision and Language, etc.

Currently, I am super excited about the potentials of Generative AI, and is seeking PhD opportunities on LLMs.
